# LinkedIn Connections Filter Tool

To export your LinkedIn connections to a CSV file you will need to follow these steps [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a566336/export-connections-from-linkedin?lang=en).

Once you have downloaded the CSV file, you can run the script from the command line by creating a `.env` file with a 'DATA_path' to your csv, installing the dependencies, and running `main.py`!
